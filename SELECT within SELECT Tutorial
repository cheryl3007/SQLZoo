SELECT within SELECT
This tutorial looks at how we can use SELECT statements within SELECT statements to perform more complex queries.

world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)

//1. List each country name where the population is larger than 'Russia'.
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name ="Russia")

//2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE continent = "Europe" AND 
      gdp/population > (SELECT gdp/population FROM world WHERE name ="United Kingdom")
      

//3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing 'Belize', 'Belgium'.
SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name IN ("Belize", "Belgium"))

//4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.
SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name ="Canada") AND 
      population < (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name ="Poland")
      
//5. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list.

SELECT name 
FROM world 
WHERE gdp > ALL (SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE continent ="Europe" AND gdp IS NOT NULL)

//6. We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the inner and outer versions.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

SELECT name, continent, area FROM world x
WHERE area >= ALL (SELECT area FROM world y
WHERE y.continent = x.continent
AND area>0)

//Another approach
SELECT x.name, x.continent, x.area 
FROM world AS x
WHERE x.area = (SELECT MAX(y.area) FROM world AS y 
WHERE x.continent = y.continent)

//Another approach

SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
WHERE x.area = (SELECT MAX(y.area) FROM world y 
WHERE x.continent =y.continent)

//7.Find all countries that belongs to a continent if each country's population is below 25000000. Show name, continent and population.
SELECT name, continent, population 
FROM world x
WHERE 25000000 > ALL (SELECT y.population FROM world y 
WHERE y.continent = x.continent)

//8. Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

SELECT name, continent FROM world x
WHERE x.population/3 > ALL (SELECT y.population FROM world y
WHERE y.continent = x.continent AND x.name <> y.name)
